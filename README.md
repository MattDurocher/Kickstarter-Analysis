Kickstarting with Excel: A Written Analysis for the "Kickstarter Analysis" Project
  
  Overview of Project
    
    Purpose: The purpose of this project was to help Louise, the owner of a successful Kickstarter campaign for her play "Fever", figure out how different campaigns for similar projects ended up. I was able to take a sample of over 4000 different Kickstarter campaigns to provide her with ample detail on campaigns with varying data points for the projects name/discription, pledged funds vs. goals, outcomes, country/currency, deadline, launch date, whether it was a staff pick or not, number of backers, spotlight status, parent categories and subcategories, percentage funded, and average donations. These data points are filled into multiple colums on the excel sheet and allowed me to come up with two major findings. The first was for Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date and the second was for Outcomes Based on Goals so that, should Louise launch another campaign, she will know the most optimal way to do so in order to get her project funded.
